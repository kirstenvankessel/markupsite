Currently I am an intern at the educational assessment organization CITO. Here, I am working on my master's thesis called "Assessing and Improving Measurement Properties of ESCS in PISA 2018". For my thesis I am investigating the measurement of the background variable Economic, Social and Cultural Status (ESCS) to see how it could be improved. Specifically, I am looking into measurement invariance and the imputation of missing data.
